Installation
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/calculator-app.git
Navigate to the Project Directory:

bash
Copy code
cd calculator-app
Build the Project:

bash
Copy code
mvn clean install
How to Run
Run the Application:

bash
Copy code
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.example.calculator.App"
Run Tests:

bash
Copy code
mvn test
Usage
After running the application, follow the prompts in the console:

sql
Copy code
Enter first number: 5
Enter second number: 3
Enter operation (add, subtract, multiply, divide): add
Result: 8.0
If you enter an invalid input or perform division by zero, the application will handle the error gracefully.

Future Enhancements
Support for advanced mathematical operations (square root, power, etc.)
Implement a graphical user interface (GUI).
Add persistent storage for past calculations.
